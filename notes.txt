TODO
 UI: title text + button to close the marker (CRITICAL) 
 Information panel button (HIGH) -- look into aframe gui library 
 model gets larger on first tracked (HIGH)
 rotation and manipulation of models (normal)
 preload and compress models before runtime (normal?)
 lerping to position (NORMAL)

NOTES
Right now, each marker has its own handler. this is because previously, having one marker handler meant that one marker being recognized moved all models to that location.
