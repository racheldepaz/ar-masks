TODO
 rotation and manipulation of models (HIGH)
 preload and compress models before runtime (normal?)
 lerping to position (NORMAL)


NOTES
Right now, each marker has its own handler. this is because previously, having one marker handler meant that one marker being recognized moved all models to that location.
